\section*{Interests}
In my free time, I have a passion for reading fantasy books, immersing myself in epic worlds reminiscent of "The Lord of the Rings" and "World of Warcraft." I also enjoy gaming, both as a form of entertainment and as a way to bond with my sons. 

I am an avid learner and find joy in coding, exploring various programming languages, and, at one point, delving into game development with Unity. Additionally, I have a creative side that I express through painting miniatures, a hobby that allows me to combine my love for art and craftsmanship.
